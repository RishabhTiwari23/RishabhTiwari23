[![My Contribution in the team Screen Shot][contribution-screenshot]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m0XIH9XannDq_zUi29-QM5WYJm92VFhB/view?usp=drive_link)

Hi, I am a software engineer working for Accenture. I am part of the backend team that is creating an End to End application for T-Mobile for the past 2 years now. I have been part of the team since starting and have made significant contribuiton.

I love to code and build cool stuff, when I am not working I am usually busy honing my skills and learning.

Please find this screen shot above from my projects gitlab. This shows my contribution for the past 1 year.

I am also attaching the feedbacks received from co-workers and managers in accenture portal.
