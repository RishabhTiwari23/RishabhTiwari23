[![My Contribution in the team Screen Shot][contribution-screenshot]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m0XIH9XannDq_zUi29-QM5WYJm92VFhB/view?usp=drive_link)

Hi, I am a software engineer working for Accenture. I am part of the backend team that is creating an End-to-End application for T-Mobile for the past 2 years now.

I have made a significant contribution to the team's success and the client. 

I have implemented more than 20+ features, which included all types of complex business requirements, while using multithreading and asynchronous programming to implement them.

I love to code and build cool stuff. When I am not working, I am usually busy honing my skills and learning.

Please find the screenshot above from my project's GitLab. This shows my contribution for the past 1 year.

I am also attaching the feedback from co-workers and managers in the Accenture portal.
